**Data types in JS**

- # Primitives
    - Null
    - Undefined
    - Boolean
    - String
    - Number
    - BigInt
    - Symbol
- # Non- Primitives/ Reference Data types
    - Objects
    - Arrays
    - Functions
    - RegExp (Regular Expression)
    - Date


There is nothing hard about these data types we are familiar with almost all of them except symbol and a little bit BigInt. So, without wasting any time we can move on to these two.

## BigInt

## Symbol



If these are the data types then what are *let*, *const* and *var* ? 

Well, these are the keywords used to declare the variables. The main difference between the three is how they scope variables.
