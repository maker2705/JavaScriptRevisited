[!Important] **JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.**

**This means that the datatypes of the variables are determined during runtime not at the compile time.**



*for example* 

```javascript 

let dynamicVariable = 34; //now it is a numer type 
dynamicVariable = 'Hello!' // a string it is now.
```
This flexibility allows us to change the type of a variable during the execution of our program, making JavaScript a dynamically typed language. 


There are several other aspects of dynamically typed language.
